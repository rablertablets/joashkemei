        <h2>ðŸ“Œ Study Tips & Techniques for Better Performance</h2>
        <p>
            Academic success isn't just about intelligence; it requires smart strategies. Students should use
            techniques like <strong>active recall</strong>, <strong>Pomodoro technique</strong>, and <strong>mind
                mapping</strong>
            to boost retention. Studying in groups, taking effective notes, and maintaining a disciplined
            study routine significantly enhance learning.

        <h2>ðŸ“Œ Developing a Growth Mindset in Academics</h2>
        <p>
            A growth mindset means believing that abilities can improve with effort. Instead of thinking,
            "I can't do this," students should adopt the attitude of <em>"I can't do this yet!"</em>.
            Encouraging perseverance, celebrating small wins, and focusing on progress rather than perfection
            helps in developing a positive learning attitude.
        </p>

        <h2>ðŸ“Œ Effective Time Management for Students</h2>
        <p>
            Managing time well is a key to academic success. Students should prioritize tasks using
            the <strong>Eisenhower Matrix</strong> (urgent vs. important), set SMART goals, and avoid procrastination
            using techniques like the "2-minute rule". Effective time management reduces stress and
            improves productivity.

        <h2>ðŸ“Œ Success Stories of Top-Performing Students</h2>
        <p>
            Many students have overcome challenges to achieve academic excellence. Hard work, resilience,
            and smart study techniques are key to success. Featuring real-life case studies of students
            who have excelled can inspire others to strive for greatness.

        <h2>ðŸ“Œ HOW THE NEW GRADING SYSTEM AFFECTED ENGLISH.</h2>
        <p>
            The most crucial subject in school, with the highest number of lessons in a week, is English.
            
            English is always the elephant in the room. It determines the mean score of the schoolâ€”whenever 
            English improves, the school improves. And in most cases, if English drops, the school drops.
            
            English is a unique subject. It is the testing language and the language of expression. All 
            compulsory subjects, except Kiswahili, are examined in English. That means a studentâ€™s average 
            way of thinking in other subjects reflects their thinking in English. This is why a schoolâ€™s 
            mean score is often close to its mean score in English.
            
            In top schools, English is often the subject with the least number of A grades. For instance, 
            Mathematics might have 80 Aâ€™s, while English has only three. In other schools, the best grade 
            in English might be an A- or a B+.
            
            It is also true that English is a challenge for top students, while Mathematics is a problem 
            for bottom students.
            
            <strong>Principals, English deserves respect. DoSs, English requires attention.</strong>
            
            Since 2023, the government has introduced a new grading system for KCSE exams. This change 
            came following recommendations from the Presidential Working Party on Education Reforms, 
            which raised concerns that the previous grading system disadvantaged learners whose best-performing 
            subjects were not considered in the final grade.
            
            The new system makes Mathematics a compulsory subject, considers the best-performing language 
            (between English, Kiswahili, and Kenya Sign Language), and includes the next five best-performing 
            subjects. The justification for this was that Mathematics would enhance numeracy, while one language 
            would improve literacy.
            
            However, this system has negatively affected English. In most schools, Kiswahiliâ€™s mean score is 
            higher than Englishâ€™s, and many students prefer Kiswahili.
            
            Two weeks ago, I was invited as a keynote speaker and guest during the launch of a revision 
            program at a national school in central Kenya. I requested to see the merit list for KCSE 2023. 
            These were the grades of the best student in that school:
            
            <ul>
                <li>English â€“ C-</li>
                <li>Kiswahili â€“ A-</li>
                <li>Mathematics â€“ A</li>
                <li>Chemistry â€“ A-</li>
                <li>Biology â€“ A-</li>
                <li>Physics â€“ A</li>
                <li>Agriculture â€“ A</li>
                <li>Geography â€“ B+</li>
            </ul>
            
            This student attained an A- with 79 points. When I asked the Chief Principal what course the 
            student was pursuing at university, the response was perplexing.
            
            <strong>What went wrong? English.</strong> Every university course has its own weighted cluster 
            points, calculated based on four key subjects. In most cases, English is one of them.
            
            Students should be reminded about the importance of English. Many focus entirely on Kiswahili 
            because it doesnâ€™t affect their aggregate grade calculation, forgetting that English plays a 
            crucial role in university course selection.
            
            As much as we study <em>'shamirisho kitondo'</em> and <em>'shamirisho kipozi'</em>, let us not 
            forget oral literature and oral skills.

        <h2>ðŸ“Œ How to set Academic targets for 2025</h2>
        <p>
            Are you after success or are you avoiding defeat? Do you want to improve or are you avoiding to drop?

            We all know that a target is a goal, an objective, something that is to be achieved at the end of it all.
            The importance of setting targets can not be overstated. From a business sense, 88% of businesses that set
            targets achieve 75% of their targets. This is from a recent finding. The same applies to high schools.

            Most students do not know what they want but they know what they don't want. After the release of a
            particular internal exam if you ask a student what grade they have gotten in a particular exam, the student
            will tell you 'Sikupata E'. The student says 'Sikupata E' because they got a D-. The happiness of avoiding E
            is bigger than the sadness of getting a D-. The student does not know what they want but they know what they
            don't want. What they don't want is to get an E.

            Truth be told, you can't achieve what you don't know. Nobody gets an A in KCSE by accident, nobody goes to
            campus by mistake and nobody pursues medicine by diffusion. A conscious deliberate decision to work coupled
            with academic programs and success mindset is needed.

            Targets help students to have a unity of purpose, align their individual ambitions to the school's vision.
            It pushes students forward and holds them accountable. Targets are a measuring stick, informs action, sets
            priorities, communicates expectations and boosts morale.

            Targets acts as the source of intrinsic motivation to students. There is a Spanish quote that says 'Sin
            motivacion no hay sacrificio, sin sacrificio no hay disciplina y sin disciplina no hay exito'. In English it
            means, 'Without motivation there is no sacrifice, without sacrifice there is no discipline and without
            discipline there is no success'. It is so true.

            The target needs to individual, consequential, sequential, challenging, specific, numerical, wholesome and
            coupled with a catchphrase.

            Individual. For the school to get a mean grade of 8.2 (B-) it means that B- is the grade with the highest
            number of students. Before the school, we have the students. Before we set the school target, each student
            should set personal targets.

            Consequential. Before setting the KCSE targets the candidates need to set targets for all the exams they
            will do between January and November. Many schools make a mistake of just jumping into setting KCSE targets
            without remembering that one thing affects another.

            Sequential. The targets of the exams between January and November should be in an increasing manner. If the
            target of the Opener exam is 7.2. The target of the mid-term exam should be higher, let's say 7.5. Then
            target for the end of term exam to be 7.8. Then the target for term two opener to be 8. It keeps on
            increasing. The objective is consistency, not intensity. The aim is to learn from battles how to win the
            war.

            Challenging. The target needs to be something that makes the students to go an extra mile. From the
            dormitory to the dining hall, from the Computer lab to the Chemistry lab, from the basketball court to the
            tuition blocks, from the school gate to the assembly, from the Principal's house to the staffroom, everyone
            should always remember that they are working for something.

            Specificity. Instead of just saying that the target is 5 or 7 or 9, we should always make it more specific.

            Numerical. Numbers never lie. Instead of saying that you want a target of B-, numeralize your target.

            Wholesome. Everyone in the school should know the target, everyone should be involved, including the cooks,
            groundsmen, nurse and gateman.

            Catchphrase. This brings extra motivation. The students should be reciting the target mean everytime in the
            assembly.

            Principals, this is the year to balance performance and results. This is the moment to align subject
            performance and grade distribution. This is the year to prove the doubters wrong.

            Maybe they are saying you are heading a small school. Maybe you don't say much in the KESSHA meetings
            because you feel like nobody can listen to you. Maybe you have trusted the process for so long and it's not
            working. Don't loose hope. One day you'll be elevated from a laughing stock to be a benchmark. Set targets
            right, have a strategy, synergy and energy to achieve it.

            It is well.
