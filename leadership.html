        <h1>Becoming an Effective Leader</h1>
        <p>
            Leadership is more than just holding a position; it is about influence, responsibility, and making a difference. At **SIMBA NI MOJA MENTORS**, we believe that true leadership starts with **self-awareness, vision, and service to others**.

        <h2>The Power of Mentorship</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Leadership in Action</h2>
        <p>
            Leadership is not just about titles; it is about taking **initiative**. Leaders emerge in different areas, whether in **schools, businesses, communities, or organizations**. Practical steps to becoming a leader include:
            <ul>
                <li>Taking responsibility and setting an example for others.</li>
                <li>Encouraging teamwork and collaboration.</li>
                <li>Developing decision-making and problem-solving skills.</li>
                <li>Staying committed to lifelong learning and self-improvement.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
