                <h1>When in Doubt, Ask for Simba Ni Moja Mentors</h1>
                <p class="intro">
                    The tagline <strong>"Simba Ni Moja"</strong>, which translates to <strong>"One Lion"</strong>, is
                    not just a catchy phrase, but a philosophy Simba holds dearly. Joash believes that in the jungle of
                    life, standing strong and having self-confidence, like a lion, is essential. However, even the lion
                    doesn't survive without a pack and that is where the concept of mentorship comes in.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Itâ€™s about creating a community that supports each other while building individual strength.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Simba's encourages people to step away from the fear of failure and the pressure of societyâ€™s
                    expectations. Instead, it teaches the importance of embracing one's true calling by instilling the
                    belief in career success. Through understanding who you are, what drives you, and how you can make a
                    meaningful impact in the society we live in.
                </p>

                <h2>Mentorship: A Key to Success</h2>
                <p>
                    In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, finding a mentor who not only inspires but also guides you to success
                    is priceless. Joash is a beacon of hope and wisdom to many striving to shape their destiny. We are
                    dedicated and equal to the task of empowering individuals to reach their full potential through
                    comprehensive coaching, training, counseling, and academic excellence programs.
                </p>

                <h2>Personal Testimony on Mentorship</h2>
                <p>
                    I was lucky to have gone to a high school that invited many people to talk to us. One of the things
                    they emphasized was getting a mentor if we desired success in life. That was when I started writing
                    in my notebook about lifeâ€™s priorities, and getting a mentor was one of them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Looking back on my university career in Science, I have realized that one key to success is
                    mentorship. This is especially true as a man in scienceâ€”we stand on the shoulders of those before
                    us. I have been extraordinarily lucky to have fantastic mentorship throughout my studies, which has
                    also translated into my non-professional life.
                </p>
